# CakePHP3-DatabaseSessionStorage
An easy way to provide a user based persistent login system without the need of cookies or sessions.

This little trick enables the user's session to be saved into the database without the need of cookies or sessions. Users are recognized by their IP-address, and their user agent.

Will add how-to's later.
